# COG Calculation MTM

Based on the following mechanical schematic, the position of the MTM's COG is computed as a function of its joint values q1 to q3

# COG Calculation PSM

The positions of the PSM's COGs are computed as a function of its corresponding joint values

The simulation of the total COG of MTM and PSM respectively is based on these considerations.
